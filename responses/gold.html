				<p><span class="quote">&ldquo;</span>Imagine that you have before you a flagon of wine. You may choose your own favourite
vintage for this imaginary demonstration, so that it be a deep shimmering crimson in
colour. You have two goblets before you. One is of <span class="goldtext">solid gold,</span> wrought in the most
<span class="skewd">exquisite patterns</span>. The other is of <span class="flip">crystal-clear glass,</span> thin as a bubble, and as transparent.
Pour and drink; and according to your choice of goblet, I shall know whether or not you
are a connoisseur of wine. For if you have no feelings about wine one way or the other,
you will want the sensation of drinking the stuff out of a vessel that may have cost
<em>thousands of pounds;</em> but if you are a member of that vanishing tribe, the amateurs of fine
vintages, you will choose the crystal, because everything about it is calculated to reveal
rather than hide the beautiful thing which it was meant to contain.<span class="quote">&rdquo;</span>
