<p>Imagine that you have before you a flagon of wine. You may choose your own favourite vintage for this imaginary demonstration, so that it be a deep shimmering crimson in
colour. You have two goblets before you. One is of solid gold, wrought in the most
exquisite patterns. The other is of <em>crystal-clear glass, thin as a bubble, and as transparent</em>.
Pour and drink; and according to your choice of goblet, I shall know whether or not you
are a connoisseur of wine. </p>

<p>For if you have no feelings about wine one way or the other,
you will want the sensation of drinking the stuff out of a vessel that may have cost
thousands of pounds; but if you are a member of that vanishing tribe, the amateurs of fine
vintages, you will choose the <em>crystal</em>, because everything about it is calculated to <em>reveal</em> rather than hide the beautiful thing which it was meant to contain.
