			<span class="firstline">he sea is calm tonight.</span><br>
<span class="p1">The tide is full, the moon lies fair
Upon the straits; on the French coast the light
Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,
Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.
Come to the window, sweet is the night-air!
Only, from the long line of spray
Where the sea meets the moon-blanched land,
<em>Listen!</em> you hear the grating roar
Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,
At their return, up the high strand,
Begin, and cease, and then <span class="flip">again begin,</span>
With tremulous cadence slow, and bring
<em>The eternal note of sadness in.</em></span></p>

		<p><span class="p2">Sophocles long ago<br>
Heard it on the <em><span class="blue">Ægean,</span></em> <br>and it brought
Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow
Of human <em><span class="blue">misery;</span></em> <em><span class="blue">we</span></em><br>
Find also in the sound a thought,
Hearing it by this distant northern <em><span class="blue">sea.</span></em></span></p>

		<p><span class="p3">The Sea of Faith
Was once, too, at the full, <br>and round earth’s shore<br>
Lay like the folds of a bright girdle <span class="skewd">furled.</span><br>
But now I only hear<br>
Its <em><span class="blue">melancholy,</span></em> long, withdrawing roar,<br>
Retreating, to the breath<br>
Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear<br>
And naked shingles of the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="p4">Ah, love, let us be <em><span class="bright">true</span></em><br>
To one another! for the world, which seems<br>
To lie before us like a land of dreams,<br>
So various, so beautiful, so new,<br>
<span class="blue">Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,<br>
Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;</span><br>
And we are here as on a <span class="dark">darkling plain</span><br>
Swept with confused alarms of <em>struggle and flight,</em><br>
Where ignorant armies clash by </span></p>

<span class="fade">night.</span>
